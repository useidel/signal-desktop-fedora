* Thu Jun 19 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.58.0-1
- A new section in the message reaction selector automatically displays all of the emoji reactions that a message has received. Now you can quickly jump on the bandwagon and add a standard sparkling heart just like everyone else already did, or you can follow your own heart and go with the anatomical heart instead.

* Wed Jun 11 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.57.0-1
- Settings used to live in a pop-out window so we popped it back in. Now, when you adjust your Settings, you’ll do it from the main screen.

* Thu Jun 05 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.56.1-1
- see previous entry

* Sun Jun 01 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.56.0-1

* Thu May 22 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.55.0-1
- Keyboard shortcuts for emoji and stickers are back! These shortcuts also save even more time because now you won't need to write in and tell us that they're broken anymore.
- We also fixed a crash on Linux distributions that don't support GTK4 yet.

* Wed May 14 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.54.0-1
- A smile is the same in any language, but now that the emoji shortcuts in Signal Desktop have been fully translated you can also :smile: or :sourire: or :微笑: in any supported language too.

* Thu May 01 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.53.0-1
- Additional small tweaks, bug fixes, and assorted plans for the future.

* Wed Apr 23 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.52.0-1
- Additional small tweaks, bug fixes, and assorted plans for the future.

* Fri Apr 18 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.51.0-1
- Fire, the wheel, and electricity were all great developments, but they were merely necessary steps along the path that created the conditions for animated GIF search to exist. Now you can experience the pinnacle of human technological advancement in Signal Desktop with a brand-new selection interface that makes it easy to quickly find an emoji, sticker, or animated GIF that's perfect for the moment.
- We also resized the picture-in-picture window and added convenient new shortcuts to mute/unmute your microphone or turn the camera on/off while a call is minimized.

* Thu Apr 10 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.50.0-1
- If you link a new Desktop on Signal Android and choose to transfer your message history, now you can also selectively transfer old attachments from your primary device too. Bring the past into the present by scrolling back in time and clicking on the download icon. As always, the transfer process is end-to-end encrypted and secure.

* Thu Apr 03 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.49.0-1
- Handful of bug fixes to keep your app running smoothly. More exciting changes on the horizon!

* Wed Mar 26 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.48.0-1

- Udo: changed the build workflow: install nodejs, nvm and pnpm as non-root user via generic linux methods and not via rpm packages anymore (also reflected in the rpm-build dependencies
- Udo: use the pnpm instructions from reproducible-builds/docker-entrypoint.sh
- Udo: clean-up of SPEC file

* Wed Mar 19 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.47.0-1
- Now you can expand your local video preview during a call to get a better look at yourself or reflect on who you are.

* Tue Mar 18 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.46.1-1
- The new "Data usage" feature in Signal settings makes it easy to choose whether or not to automatically download photos, videos, audio files, or other documents. If Signal stops automatically downloading the latest tracks from your friend's boyfriend's band in the group chat, you can save your taste in music along with some free space on your hard drive.
-  Now when you attempt to start a chat with someone's Signal username, it will work even if you accidentally type the “@” symbol first. Some h@bits @re h@rd to bre@k.

* Wed Mar 12 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.46.0-1

* Fri Mar 07 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.45.1-1

- Udo: added pnpm to build dependencies

* Thu Mar 06 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.45.0-1

- Udo: nan patch updated

* Thu Feb 27 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.44.0-1
- We fixed a minor animation bug during group calls. We apologize in advance if the most exciting part of your day was switching to grid view during a meeting and trying to catch the moment where the video squares from people who joined late sometimes partially obscured the slide deck your boss was presenting.

* Wed Feb 19 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.43.0-1
- Valentine's Day is all about celebrating a perfect match, so we updated the text label on a single button in the Desktop app to create a cute couple with the same button on your phone. This sounds like a very small change, and it is, but sometimes it's the little things that show how much you care.

* Wed Feb 05 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.42.0-1
- Now when you link your primary Signal device to a new Desktop, you can bring your chat history and your last 45 days of media with you. The transfer process is end-to-end encrypted, and completely optional. When it comes to making the choice about whether or not to leave the past behind, you're left to your own devices.

* Wed Feb 05 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.41.0-1
- We fixed a rare bug that prevented some chats from opening correctly after they were selected, so now Signal Desktop doesn't also draw a blank while you're trying to remember what they said.

* Sun Feb 02 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.40.1-2
- Udo: partial workaround for failing backbone patch

* Sun Feb 02 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.40.1-1

- Udo: workaround for failing builds with electron 33.x

* Wed Jan 29 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.40.0-1
- We fixed a rare bug that prevented some chats from opening correctly after they were selected, so now Signal Desktop doesn't also draw a blank while you're trying to remember what they said.

* Sat Jan 25 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.39.0-1
- Now you can adjust the size of the chat list sidebar on touchscreen devices. So when you try to drag it won't be such a drag, and the smudges on your screen are simply evidence of the power emanating from your fingertips.

* Mon Jan 20 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.38.0-1
- We fixed a bug with @ mentions that sometimes incorrectly included your own account in the autocomplete suggestion list. As a narcissistic workaround, you can still use third-person narration to talk about yourself in your group chats if you ever miss this bug. 

* Wed Jan 08 2025 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.37.0-1
- Now you can easily see the progress of attachment downloads. You can also stop and restart in-progress downloads too. So if a transfer is slowed because you're on the road (in airplane mode?) or the mediocre hotel WiFi is about to implode, you can wait to reload when more available bandwidth is bestowed.

* Thu Dec 19 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.36.1-1
- see previous entry

* Thu Dec 12 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.36.0-1
- This update fixes a bug on macOS Sonoma that prevented screen sharing from working correctly if permission to share the screen had previously been denied — so you no longer need to share your screen with an error message.
- Filter by Unread now highlights the selected chat, and the list of unread chats will automatically update as new messages arrive or when you catch up in one chat and click on another.

* Wed Dec 11 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.35.1-2
- Udo: workaround for backbone patch with hunks

* Thu Dec 05 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.35.1-1
- The new filter icon next to the search box makes it easy to quickly find unread chats, but feel free to take your time deciding whether or not to leave them on read after seeing what they had to say.

* Thu Dec 05 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.35.0-1
- The new filter icon next to the search box makes it easy to quickly find unread chats, but feel free to take your time deciding whether or not to leave them on read after seeing what they had to say.

* Thu Nov 21 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.34.0-1
- This update introduces support for new processors on Windows like the Snapdragon X Elite, so you don't need to twist your ARM into emulating x86 anymore.  
- We also fixed a bug that broke the dark theme in Signal when your operating system settings were configured to use a light theme. Signal Desktop can now properly handle your thematically split personality.

* Wed Nov 13 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.33.0-1
- This update fixes a bug where the correct context menu wasn't appearing after right-clicking on an emoji while selecting text. Thanks, @khuddite [github.com]!

* Thu Nov 07 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.32.0-1
- Thanks to some small optimizations, this update slightly reduces the size of the app by approximately 4 megabytes. That's enough room for you to send the equivalent of about 4 books’ worth of text messages (or 2-3 animated GIFs) without taking up any extra space.
- If Wayland is your compositing window manager (and not just the name of a blacksmith you vaguely remember from Beowulf) you'll be happy to hear that we also fixed a bug with the screen sharing button on Linux.

* Thu Oct 31 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.31.0-1
- Now you can quickly download every photo in an album when you receive a message with multiple attachments. But if you were a gallery curator with impeccable taste in another life, you can still save them individually too. Thanks, @major-mayer [github.com]!

* Thu Oct 24 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.30.0-1
- Introducing Call Links: The missing link for calendar invites and impromptu gatherings.
- Now you can quickly create an easy link that anyone on Signal can use to join a group call without having to join a Signal group chat first.
- Call links are reusable and ideal for recurring phone dates with your best friends or weekly check-ins with your coworkers.
- You can manage your call links, control approval settings, and copy links from the calls tab for quick sharing.

* Wed Oct 16 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.29.0-1
- This update improves startup speed by around 5%, so feel free to slow down a little bit in other areas of your life.  

* Thu Oct 10 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.28.0-1
-  We fixed a bug that prevented stickers from working correctly in the media editor, and now the picker no longer gets stuck when you're trying to stick a sticker on a picture.
- This update also includes support for the new screen sharing interface in macOS Sequoia.

* Thu Oct 03 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.27.0-1
- Now you can remove quoted replies from edited messages. It's perfect for those moments when you realize that your response was so good that it doesn't actually need to stand on another message's shoulders, or when you accidentally reply to the wrong message with "I love you too."

* Thu Sep 26 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.26.0-1
- Sometimes leaving something behind is the best way to discover that you want to find it again, so we fixed a bug that made it difficult to search for groups that you're no longer a part of anymore but that still remain in your conversation list (and quite possibly in your heart).

* Thu Sep 19 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.25.0-1
- Take a trip down memory lane with the new and improved "All Media" view. Now when you click on a chat header and select "See all" in the shared media section, older photos and videos will automatically appear as you scroll instead of being limited to the most recent entries.

* Fri Sep 13 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.24.1-1
- see below
- Udo: bogus date from 7.24.0-1 corrected

* Thu Sep 12 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.24.0-1
- This update fixes a bug where viewing a missed call on one device wouldn't automatically clear the indicator for that missed call on your other devices, which was a missed opportunity for your missed call list to better coexist. 

* Wed Sep 04 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.23.0-1
- Chats now open faster than ever thanks to another round of performance improvements, so you can click on your cliques and see what they're saying real quick.
- We also fixed a handful of bugs, including one that sometimes caused "Unknown contact started a video call" to appear in the chat list summary after you started the call. Even if you're still on a journey of self-discovery, you are never completely unknown to yourself.

* Fri Aug 30 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.22.2-2
- Udo: remove of unneeded but pre-packaged patch for nodes socks-proxy-agent and types-express 

* Fri Aug 30 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.22.2-1
- see previous entry

* Fri Aug 30 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.22.1-1
- see previous entry

* Thu Aug 29 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.22.0-1
- Signal Desktop can now automatically resume interrupted attachment downloads from where they left off, so you won't need to wait as long to laugh even if you close your laptop lid before the meme your friend sent you has finished transferring.

* Thu Aug 22 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.21.0-1
- Everyone loves a good story, and we could tell you the tale of a bug that sometimes caused the progress bar to freeze right in the middle of watching a good story — but that bug's adventure already has a happy ending because we fixed it in this release.

* Tue Aug 20 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.20.1-3
- Udo: clean up SPEC file (old build reqs)

* Mon Aug 19 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.20.1-2
- Udo: fixing build reqs

* Mon Aug 19 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.20.1-1
- see below
- Udo: fixed bogus date of 7.20.0

* Thu Aug 15 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.20.0-1
- Stories with long captions are displayed on a subtle gradient background that improves contrast and makes the text easier to read. Now that people can see what you're saying, feel free to write a couple paragraphs about why something really made you laugh instead of just saying "lol."
- This release also improves the performance of link preview generation and fixes a bug that caused the Settings window to briefly flash a lovely shade of ultramarine whenever it was closed (instead of just closing right away).

* Tue Aug 13 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.19.1-1
- Stories with long captions are displayed on a subtle gradient background that improves contrast and makes the text easier to read. Now that people can see what you're saying, feel free to write a couple paragraphs about why something really made you laugh instead of just saying "lol."
- This release also improves the performance of link preview generation and fixes a bug that caused the Settings window to briefly flash a lovely shade of ultramarine whenever it was closed (instead of just closing right away).
- This update fixes an issue affecting some users, a crash with the error "The expression evaluated to a falsy value."

* Wed Aug 07 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.19.0-1
- If another call is calling your name, we added a shortcut to leave the current call and join a new one. You'll be prompted to confirm your departure, but it's up to you whether or not you say goodbye first.
- This update also fixes a startup crash on Linux for users whose locale is set to POSIX.

* Thu Aug 01 2024 Dennis Gilmore <dennis@ausil.us> 7.18.0-2
- Udo: add ~/bin into PATH for aarch64 builds

* Thu Aug 01 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.18.0-1
- A quick goodbye is sometimes easier than a slow farewell, so we sped up the process of deleting large message threads.

* Sat Jul 27 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.17.0-3
- Udo: added logic to handle corner case for fpm on AARCH64

* Fri Jul 26 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.17.0-2
- Udo: nodejs >=20.15.0 is required (not shipped by fedora -> repo https://rpm.nodesource.com/ needed)

* Thu Jul 25 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.17.0-1
- We wanted things to be slicker and quicker for sticker clickers, so we fixed a bug that sometimes prevented Signal from launching the sticker viewer if you tried to open a sticker pack link while the app was closed. 

* Wed Jul 17 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.16.0-1
- We fixed a bug that prevented the button to minimize a call from appearing while that call was reconnecting. Now you don't need to feel disconnected from previous chats even if the internet is feeling disconnected.

* Wed Jul 03 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.15.0-1
- Now you can forward contact cards that were sent from a mobile device. Share the take-out number for your favorite restaurant without taking out your phone.
- New support for high-resolution "jumbomoji" adds larger-than-life detail to large emoji, especially on big screens with small pixels.
- We also updated the Sticker Creator to support the latest Emoji, so today's stickers are no longer stuck with yesterday's Unicode standard.

* Thu Jun 27 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.14.0-1
- If you're tired of losing your voice, we fixed a bug where switching to another chat or application while recording a voice message could cause that message to disappear. In-progress voice messages are now saved as drafts so you can review and send them when you return to the chat.

* Thu Jun 20 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.13.0-1
- We fixed a bug that displayed images with the wrong aspect ratio if you resized the Signal Desktop window while viewing someone's profile picture. The people you love should only look squeezed if you are giving them a hug.
- This update also improves the display of quoted replies in RTL languages.

* Wed Jun 12 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.12.0-1
- Raise your hand if you've been looking for another way to communicate during group calls. The new Raise Hand feature is a simple way to get someone's attention, ask a question, or unanimously vote for a group proposal when your friend asks "all those in favor?"
- We modified the keyboard shortcut for sending a voice note to Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Y so that it no longer conflicts with the "Paste and Match Style" shortcut on Windows and Linux.
- We broke up with a bug in the crop tool, so now it's easier and more intuitive to cut your ex (or anything else) out of the picture.

* Tue Jun 04 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.11.1-1
- see below

* Thu May 30 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.11.0-1
- We fixed a rendering bug that caused the contacts icon to smash itself right next to the contact's name while viewing the list of participants in a group call. You're probably really close to your contacts, but sometimes you (and the Signal Desktop user interface) both need a little space.

* Wed May 22 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.10.0-2
- Udo: Added ruby-devel to build requirements

* Wed May 22 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.10.0-1

- Additional small tweaks, bug fixes, and performance enhancements. Thanks for using Signal!

* Wed May 08 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.8.0-1
- Now you can react with any emoji during a Signal call. Smile even if your camera is off, share a heart if you love what you're hearing, or vote for sushi instead of pizza without saying a word. And you'll even see an animation of everyone's emojional outburst if enough people in the call react with the same emoji all at once.

* Wed May 01 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.7.0-1
- Tweaks, bug fixes, and performance enhancements. Keep on texting, calling, and video chatting as usual.

- see below

* Tue Apr 16 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.5.0-1
- We added support for custom nicknames and notes for anyone you're chatting with on Signal, even if they aren't in your system contacts. Whether you're adding the missing letters in a lazy friend's profile name, or a reminder about where you met, notes and nicknames provide a convenient and secure way to jot down additional details about your Signal Connections — and they're end-to-end encrypted and protected by your Signal PIN so they can be securely restored if you lose your phone too.
- Now you can minimize Signal to your system tray on Linux. If your taskbar is the right shade of gray, it’s like your messages are waiting for you on a silver platter.
- For users on Windows, this update re-enables support for detailed unread message counts on the Signal icon. Say goodbye to “9+” because now the icon goes to 11 (or higher).

* Fri Mar 29 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.4.0-1
- This update clears out a few bugs just in time for spring cleaning, including more consistent conversation sort logic and improved behavior if the app encounters DNS lookup timeouts due to poor network connectivity.

- see below

* Thu Mar 21 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.3.0-1
- Now you can clear missed calls on your phone and the badge on the calls tab in Signal Desktop will be updated too.
- We also redesigned the badge count indicator on Windows. Now the color in the taskbar matches the color in the system tray. Fashion is all about coordination, and a little pop of red is a perfect look for spring.

* Tue Mar 19 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.2.1-1
- see below

* Thu Mar 14 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.2.0-1
- Thanks to the performance improvements in this release, opening large group chats is faster than ever. If you're in a group with several hundred people that likes to debate the existence of parallel universes, you now live in a timeline where it takes a lot less time to show the timeline of people talking about timelines.

* Thu Mar 07 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.1.1-1
- see below

* Thu Mar 07 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.1.0-1
- This update enables support for all of the new emoji characters in Emoji version 15.1. People keep asking us what our favorite new emoji is, but answering that question is a “lime” we won't cross.

* Thu Feb 29 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 7.0.0-1
- Your phone number will no longer be visible to anyone on the latest version of Signal unless they have it saved in their phone’s contacts. You can change this in Settings.
- You can now set and share an optional username to let people chat with you without giving them your phone number.
- A new privacy setting lets you control who can find you by your phone number on Signal.

- see below

* Tue Feb 20 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.48.0-1
- Video and audio playback will now pause whenever the Signal window is closed and minimized in the system tray. If you’re looking for silence, X marks the spot.  
- By popular demand, emoticons like “:-)” now automatically become emoji like “🙂” — but if this makes you “:-(“ you can disable this feature in the “Chats” section of your Signal Desktop settings

* Thu Feb 15 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.47.1-1
- see version 6.47.0-1

* Thu Feb 08 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.47.0-1
- If you spend a lot of time trying to pick out the perfect emoji reaction for every situation, you'll be to know that we fixed a bug with typing indicators that sometimes caused the emoji selection box to disappear while you were in the middle of pondering your choices.
- Signal will now match your selected title bar color on Microsoft Windows. When all of your windows in Windows look the same, that's a common theme.

* Wed Jan 31 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.46.0-1
- The default fonts for Urdu have been updated for improved readability when that language is selected (Signal Settings > Appearance > Language). Thanks, @asakpke [github.com]!

* Wed Jan 24 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.45.0-1
- Now you can optionally turn emoticons into emoji. If you want to “🙂” whenever you type “:-)”, you can enable this feature in the “Chats” section of your Signal Desktop settings.  
- A new keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+s/Cmd+s) helps you quickly save pictures and videos from the media viewer.
- It’s too bad that we already made a New Year's Resolution joke in the release notes for the last update, because we just increased the maximum resolution for screen sharing during Signal video calls. Our new resolution is to avoid any resolution puns until 2025.
- Thanks to @dasois [github.com] and @pelya [github.com] for their contributions to this release!  

* Thu Jan 18 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.44.1-1

* Thu Jan 11 2024 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.44.0-1

- Region-neutral font fallback logic improves how CJK characters are displayed across different locales.
- Thanks to @0o001 [github.com], @hackerbirds [github.com], @rschiang [github.com], @vijithassar [github.com], and @yaslama [github.com] for their contributions to this release!

- The playback speed indicators in voice messages have a slightly new look. X marks the spot. Thanks, @Shrinks99!
- We would also like to thank @NetSysFire, @timjamello, and @u32i64 for their contributions to this release.

* Sat Dec 23 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.42.1-1

- Thanks to @qauff and @wyvurn-h4x3r for their help with this release.

* Thu Dec 14 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.42.0-1

* Thu Nov 30 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.41.0-1
- We fixed the transition animation for video tiles when someone joins or leaves a group call. When you see a friend's face slide into view, that's a social movement.
-  Now you can click on a profile photo or group avatar in the chat header to quickly access chat settings or view any unseen stories from that chat. Thanks, @bhaskarraksahb [github.com]!

- Now you can change your selected language in Signal without changing your system settings (Signal Settings > Appearance > Language).
- We fixed a brief delay that sometimes occurred while joining a call lobby on macOS devices, which should get rid of at least one excuse
    for being a half-second late to the meeting.

* Thu Nov 02 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.37.0-1
- We've added a new way to keep your Signal contacts nice and tidy. This Halloween season, remove the ghost of an old contact. Just click on the three dots next to their
    name in the contact list on the New Chat screen and select "Remove."

* Wed Oct 25 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.36.0-1
- We updated the user interface to better indicate when a group video call is reconnecting. Now you'll see blurred thumbnails instead of what used to look like an elaborate prank where everyone pretended to freeze at the same time.  
- The system tray icon will no longer appear pixelated on Ubuntu Linux, unless you've managed to get Ubuntu Linux running on an old smart refrigerator with a low-res screen.

* Fri Oct 20 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.35.0-1
- We told ourselves that we would never do this, that we wouldn't be like the other apps with their lazy release notes, but this update really does include "bug fixes
and UX improvements."

* Mon Oct 16 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.34.1-1
- Typing indicators in group chats will now display multiple profile pictures if more than one person is typing. James Cameron convinced us that we didn't need to stop after one avatar.
- Now you can right-click on any sent message or press the up arrow on your keyboard to edit what you just said! Fix a tpyo, include the missing ingredient in grandma's chocolate chip cookie recipe, or add the punchline to a joke if you hit the send button too quickly. The choice is yours. Messages will always show when they have been edited, and you can click on the "Edited" indicator to see the full edit history for any edited messages. Update the past in the present to prevent future confusion today!

* Fri Sep 29 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.32.0-1
- If you say "media editor" five times fast, it starts to sound like "mediator" — but the new media editor is so much easier to use that you'll no longer feel like you need a mediator to settle a fight between you and the crop tool.
- Sometimes the right reply can really help you get to the bottom of what people are saying, and now Signal will automatically scroll to what you just said whenever you send a message in a chat.


* Thu Sep 21 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.31.0-1
- This update fixes a handful of bugs, including one that caused the main Signal window to go blank if you viewed a debug log in full-screen mode on macOS. Seeing a completely Light or completely Dark window is arguably the purest possible expression of the Light Theme and Dark Theme, but we ultimately decided that the app is easier to use when you can see the interface too.

* Wed Sep 13 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.30.2-1
- Keep tabs on your calls with the new calls tab. Start a new call or return a call that you missed without having to find the corresponding chat. Now you can say hello with your voice without also saying goodbye to the unread marker for messages in that thread.

* Wed Aug 09 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.28.0-1
- We modified the notification icons that appear for group updates, like when someone new joins a group. These icons help improve legibility, especially if you live within the darkness of the Dark Theme. The previous icons merely adopted the dark. The new icons were born in it, molded by it.

* Tue Aug 01 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.27.1-1
- This update includes a few improvements for voice and video calls, and some minor documentation updates (thanks, @vijithassar).

- In addition to a small assortment of bug fixes, this release also incorporates developer documentation updates (thanks, @d108!) and some design improvements to the message forwarding interface (thanks, @hackerbirds!).

* Thu Jun 22 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.22.0-1
- Format text in your messages by selecting any text in the message composition field. Make a bold statement that's actually bold, send M. Night Shyamalan a twist ending with a spoiler effect, emphasize a name by writing "Alex" in italics, put a line through a rejected dinner idea with strikethrough, or share code in monospace.
- We added support for the latest emoji characters, so now you can express your excitement with "Shaking Face" (🫨) or react with a "Pea Pod" (🫛) when someone asks you how close you are to your friends.


* Thu Jun 15 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.21.0-1
- Get a better look at yourself while a 1-on-1 call is ringing. Individual video calls now use the same full-screen view that previously only appeared at the beginning of a new group call. When it comes to being consistent, we try to be persistent (not resistant) and now the discrepancy is nonexistent because these things are no longer different.
-  We'd also like to express our appreciation to @complexspaces for their help and feedback while working on this release.

* Fri Jun 09 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.20.2-1

* Thu May 25 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.19.0-1

- If you are on a version of Windows before Windows 10, or a version of Ubuntu before 20.04 LTS, you will need to update your operating system to continue using Signal: https://support.signal.org/hc/articles/5109141421850-Supporting-Older-Operating-Systems 

* Tue May 23 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.18.1-1
- We've added additional translations for certain UI strings 

* Thu May 18 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.18.0-1
-  Use the "Navigate by section" keyboard shortcuts (⌘/Ctrl+T & ⌘/Ctrl+F6) to quickly move between different areas of the app. It's like a - superhero version of the Tab key that can fly further and faster than its mild-mannered alter ego.  
- We added support for optional message sounds so that you can also hear notifications for sent and received messages while a chat is - open (Settings > Notifications).
- Jump to the latest unread message in a chat (⌘/Ctrl+J) without touching the mouse or helping the touchpad live up to its name.
- Updated icons give the app a fresh look and help improve legibility. There's a new "Copy text" option in the triple-dot menu too. Thanks, @yusufsahinhamza!

* Thu Mar 23 2023 Udo Seidel <udoseidel@gmx.de> 6.11.0-1
- Start talking to yourself even faster with a new icon that makes the “Note to Self” chat easier to find. Thanks to @hackerbirds on GitHub for their contribution.
